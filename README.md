# Learning Backend with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose

## Project Overview

This repository is part of my learning journey in backend development using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose. The goal is to create a fully functional RESTful API that interacts with a MongoDB database using Mongoose as the object data modeling (ODM) library.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing data in a flexible, JSON-like format.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM library for MongoDB and Node.js, making it easier to manage MongoDB with schemas.

## Features

- RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- MongoDB for data persistence.
- Mongoose for schema-based modeling.
- Middleware for handling requests and responses.
- Error handling for clean API responses.
